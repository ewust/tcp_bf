TCP Brute Force
---------------

Attempt to break the same-origin policy using a brute force TCP attack.

Receive a few connections from a victim to learn upper 8 bits of sequence
number, and source port pattern (increment by 1, etc).

Then, have the victim make several connections to site (not attacker
controlled), and the rest should be obvious :)
